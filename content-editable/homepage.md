Section: What we do
* Speaking & Moderation

Keynotes, panels, and interviews on AI, tech policy, and the culture of innovation—delivered with reporter rigor and audience-first clarity. We prepare with bespoke research briefs and pre-interviews, shape questions that surface newsworthy insights, and manage pacing, audience Q&A, and on-stage dynamics so your program lands on time and on message.

* Journalism & Reporting

Weekly analysis and breaking news for top-tier German media (FAZ, ARD, Deutschlandfunk), backed by deep sourcing in the San Francisco Bay Area. We file radio features, live shots, and explainers, and we bring European policy context to U.S. tech developments so international audiences get the “why” behind the “what.”

* Video & Audio Production

Executive interviews, explainers, and event coverage with editorial depth. Podcast development and production from pilots to multi-episode series. Services include concepting, scripts, booking, field or remote recording, multi‑camera 4K capture, editing, color, sound design/mixing, and packaging for web and social distribution.

* Strategic Media Consulting

Narrative development for companies, founders, and public figures. Messaging frameworks, story playbooks, and editorial guidance that resonate across channels. We also provide executive media training, newsroom‑quality content workflows, and thought‑leadership programs that build credibility over time.

* Employee Training (AI Literacy & Implementation)

Elevate your team’s AI fluency and ship real use cases. We cover why AI literacy matters, how to implement AI in companies—from API integrations to network/router considerations—and how to make your brand discoverable inside ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity. Book us for onsite or virtual company events and workshops.

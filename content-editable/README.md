# Content Editing Guide

This folder contains clean, editable markdown files for each page of your website. You can edit these files to improve your content, then update the actual site files when ready.

## Files

1. **homepage.md** - Main landing page content
2. **about.md** - About page content
3. **contact.md** - Contact page content

## How to Edit

1. Open any `.md` file in this folder
2. Edit the content as needed
3. Save your changes
4. When ready, the content can be transferred back to the actual site files in `/content/`

## Content Structure

Each file is organized with:
- Clear section headers
- Subsections for different content blocks
- Bullet points for lists
- **Bold** text for emphasis
- Horizontal rules (---) to separate major sections

## Tips for Better Content

- Keep paragraphs concise and focused
- Use active voice
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Include specific examples and achievements
- Maintain consistent tone throughout

## Next Steps

After editing these files, the updated content needs to be integrated back into the Hugo site structure. The actual site files are located in:
- `/content/_index.md` (homepage)
- `/content/about/_index.md`
- `/content/contact/_index.md`
